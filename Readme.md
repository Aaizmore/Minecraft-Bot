This is a very simple bot that demonstrates the use of the mineflayer library.

 - Carpeting (fill surface with a white carpet): https://youtu.be/tKTukPgVf7Q

## Run The Bot

 - node minecraft-bot.js <username> <server-version> <server-ip> <server-port>

## Control The Bot

 - the bot is by default in idle mode; whisper a command to the bot; valid commands are:
   - idle (just wave hands occasionally)
   - stop (the same as idle, stop current activity)
